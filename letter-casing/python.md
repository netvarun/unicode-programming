# Letter Casing in Python

Letter casing methods are available for strings (`str` objects) in the core
language and always have Unicode semantics.

```python
lowercase = str.lower
uppercase = str.upper
titlecase = str.capitalize
casefold  = str.casefold
```

The `casefold` method was added in Python 3.3.
