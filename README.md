Unicode Programming Examples
============================

A collection of Unicode-related tasks in multiple programming languages.  Feel
free to add or improve examples and new languages.

# Style guide

The main goal is to have a cohesive style where examples in different languages
can easily be compared, as opposed to following the most popular styles for each
language.

* document syntax: Markdown
* code indentation: four spaces
* naming convention: single-word lower-case names
* string literals: preference for single quotes over double quotes
